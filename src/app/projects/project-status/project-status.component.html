    <h1>Lower East Side Cannabis Dispensary â€“ Studio Project</h1>
    <h2>Repurposing and full-scale gut renovation of existing structure + Furnishing</h2>
    <h3>16000 sq ft</h3>
    <p>The dispensary seeks to acknowledge the multiple facets of its product, bend them apart, turn them over and shed
        light on each. Translucent glass walls partition the dispensary. Tilted, the walls lean into and away from each other.</p>
    <p>Consumers and employees alike are encouraged to investigate the glass. The goal: enjoy dynamic, multifaceted views
        of cannabis cultivation, sale, and consumption.</p>
